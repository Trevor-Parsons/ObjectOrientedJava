For project 6, I used a GridPane in JavaFX to store a 10x10 array of button objects that could be used to play battleship. The nodes in the GridPane were give priority to resize dynamically when the window size was changed. The horizontal variables (Hits, Misses, Sunk) were also placed in the GridPane, under column 0. Finally, the GridPane with the game board was placed in a BorderPane in the center and a Label was placed at the top of the BorderPane that would display game text. Sometime in the future I plan on filling in the code for the actual game, as it would be good practice for event-driven programming.
