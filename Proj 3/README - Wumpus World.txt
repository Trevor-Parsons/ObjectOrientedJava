Wumpus World Class Documentation
Trevor Parsons 

	The Wumpus World program is composed of three classes: Square, WumpusWorld, and Project3. The Square class is used primarily to hold values of "1" or "0" for the breezy, stench, pit, person, wumpus, and gold variables. During gameplay, if a Square object has a value of "1" for any of its member variables then the square it represents on the game board has also that characteristic. The opposite is true for Square member variables that have a value of "0". The Square class setter methods are used to alter the values of Square objects between "1" and "0", and the getter methods are used to access the value stored in Square member variables. None of the members or methods of WumpusWorld or Project3 classes are used in the Square class.
	The WumpusWorld class is used to generate a random game board, print the game board in 2-D text format, provide the status of the square the person is on, and move the person around the game board. The only member variable in the WumpusWorld class is a 2-D array of Square objects that is used to represent the game board, meaning the relationship between WumpusWorld and Square is "has a".  In the WumpusWorld constructor, the game board array is initialized with random values (that are in accordance with the rules of the game) using Square class getter and setter methods. Similarly, the print, square status, and person movement methods also use the Square getters and setters to appropriately access and change Square member variable values during gameplay. 
	Finally, the Project3 class is used to play the game. Project3 makes use of both WumpusWorld and Square methods during gameplay. For example, when the user moves the location of the human on the game board, a WumpusWorld method is called, which then calls a Square method in order to update the location. Project3 does not call any Square methods directly but does call them indirectly through WumpusWorld method calls.
