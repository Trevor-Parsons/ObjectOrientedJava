The first is a class called LinearEquation that stores two linear equations.

ax + by = e

cx + dy = f

x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)

y = (af-ec) / (ad - bc)

 

It should have:

Private data fields a, b, c, d, e and f

Constructor that takes in arguments for a through f.

Six getter methods for a, b, c, d, e, and f

A method named isSolvable() that returns true if a*d - b*c is not 0.

Methods getX() and getY() that return the solution for the equation.

 

Submission should include a UML diagram for this class.

Lastly, write a test program (class) that prompts the user for the six values and report if the equation has a solution. If so, display the solution.

For submission, submit the two source .java files and your UML diagram.
